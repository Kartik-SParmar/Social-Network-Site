# Social-Network-Site
This is my individual semester project.
The coding is orignal and created by myself. The basic idea is to create a site that allow individuals to 
(1) construct a public or semi-public profile within a bounded system, 
(2) articulate a list of other users with whom they share a connection, and 
(3) view and traverse their list of connections and those made by others within the system.

Technlogies used for this project:
(a)PHP
(b)HTML
(c)CSS
(d)JavaScript
(e)XAMPP server

DataBase connectivity:
